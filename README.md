### My Experience

__Data Scientist__

_Upwork/Freelance_

I enjoyed working as a freelance - project based data scientist. I did many projects; however, these are my top 3:

â€¢ Extracted tweets related to mental health and Covid-19 via Twitter API, processed the tweets from raw Twitter data in JSON format with Python's Pandas library, and performed Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling (LDA) revealed topics as depression and anxiety. 
â€¢ Built a web scraper for collecting product information from a website in the retail industry by mocking example websites for unit-testing purposes and upgrading methods, and HTML and CSS tags from an existing source code based on object-oriented programming with Python's requests and beautiful soup libraries. 
â€¢ Wrote R scripts on R-Studio, transformed non-univariate time-series data into the univariate format by interpolating the missing values and compressing the repeated values, forecasted prices with several models, such as AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, ARIMAX, and evaluated model performances based on AIC and BIC scores. 



__Data Science Fellow__

_Springboard_

I mastered my skills in Python, SQL and machine learning. I wrote numerous simple to complex SQL queries involving self joins, correlated subqueries, and CTEs to obtain data from multiple tables for diverse business requirements. Also, I did the following projects using Python, Scikit-learn and Databricks:

â€¢ Built a machine learning pipeline with 0.97 precision and 0.79 recall scores using Logistic Regression to automate the workflow and prevent data leakage while applying over-and under-sampling methods for addressing imbalanced class distribution to predict fraudulent transactions. 
â€¢ Crafted a Logistic Regression model that predicts helpful customer reviews with a 0.98 recall score by extracting features from the corpus using regular expressions, optimizing the model based on predicted probabilities, and implementing a custom threshold level.  
â€¢ Built Logistic Regression and Random Forest machine learning pipelines with 0.88+ AUC ROC scores by wrangling data using PySpark and Spark SQL on Databricks. 



**Graduate Assistant** *(acted as a Data Scientist)*

_University at Buffalo_

I started with integrated public data sets at the individual and occupational levels by building an entity-relationship model and performing feature engineering on the matching fields to ensure data integrity. On top of that, I crafted > 700 lines of well-documented code using Python according to the principles of object-oriented programming to automate data wrangling, data compression, and produce easy-to-read summary tables. Finally, I applied weighted regression models to predict returns for STEM skills in the labor market. While performing the above tasks, I benefited from Git and GitHub for securing the source code and the Jupyter notebooks 



__Data Analyst__

_Dokuz Eylul University_

I utilized SPSS to identify key features of customer churn based on the data collected from local fitness centers. Moreover, I developed a survey to measure the relationship between entrepreneurship and innovative marketing behavior in the scope of start-up and middle-sized (SMEs) companies. Additionally, I delivered lectures in various business and marketing topics, such as Principles of Marketing and Marketing Management
